## Software Engineering
### SDLC - Software Development Lifecycle

    - Iterative
    - Agile (Scrum)

    - DevOps Lifecycle 
        - Linux
        - SCM ( Source code management tools )
        - Build Tools 
        - Development Tools
        - CI/CD i.e Continuous Integration and Continuous deployment
- The Software Development Lifecycle ( SDLC ) outlines an structured process for creating high quality software.
- Here are the following models : 
#### Waterfall Model
- **Overview** : A linear sequential approach, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
- **Phases**
    1. Requirement Analysis : Gather all requirements upfront.
    2. System Design : Plan the system architecture.
    3. Implementation : Develop the code based on the design.
    4. Testing : Validate the system against requirements.
    5. Deployment : Delivered the finished product to the client.
    6. Maintenance : Address post-deployment issues and updates.

- **Advantages** :
    - Simple and easy to manage
    - Works well with small projects with well defined requirements.
- **Disadvantage**
    - Inflexible to changes
    - Late testing can lead to identifying critical defects late in the cycle.

#### Iterative Model 
- **Overview** : Develop the system in small iterations, allowing for incremental development and refinements based on the feedback.
- **Phases (Per Iteration) :**
    1. Requirement Gathering and Planning : Focus on subset of the system
    2. Design - Plan for the specific iteration 
    3. Implementation and testing - Development and test the portion
    4. Evaluation - Gather feedback and refine the next iteration

- **Advantage**
    - Incorporate user feedback early and often
    - Identifies and resolves risks at early stages 

#### Agile Model
- **Overview** : A flexible, iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes collaboration, continuos feedback, and adaptive planning. Agile breaks development into smaller cycles called sprints (typically 2-4 weeks long ) 

- Key principles
    - Prioritize customer collaboration over customer negotiation
